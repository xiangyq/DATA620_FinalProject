###DATA 620 Final Project
**Text Mining and Gene Network Analysis with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer**

In this project, I integrate text mining and network analysis for informative discoveries in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer area. I mine the available scientific papersâ€™ abstracts at Pubmed, which are relevant to the topic of NSCLC. And then I extract co-occurrences of genes and build the network of gene-gene interaction. By analyzing the gene network, I look for those important molecular markers relate to NSCLC.
